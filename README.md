Task 1: processArray Function
The processArray function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with each even number squared and each odd number tripled. This function is used to manipulate numerical data and can be useful in various mathematical operations.
Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd. This function can be used to format text data based on numerical conditions.
Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
The createUserProfiles function takes two arrays as input: an array of original names and an array of modified names generated by the formatArrayStrings function. It returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1. This function can be used to create user profiles with formatted names and unique IDs.
Files:
arrayManipulation.js: contains the processArray and formatArrayStrings functions.
userInfo.js: contains the createUserProfiles function.
These functions can be used together to manipulate numerical data, format text data, and create user profiles with unique IDs.
